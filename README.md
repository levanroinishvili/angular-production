# Very small **production environment** for Angular 4

In addition to excluding tens of thousands of files which Angular Quickstart comes with (mostly in node_modules folder),
this customised package also has a slightly different folder structure. Various config files were changed to match this structure.

After cloning this repo, there is no need to run `npm install`. The repo includes all the necessary node modues.
If any modules are found missing, I will add them in.

To quickly set up a matching development environment, have a look at my other repo

The development environment includes more files which are necessary for transpiling TypeScript into JavaScript, also testing modules.
